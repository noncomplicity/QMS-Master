## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This Part of 82304 applies to the SAFETY and SECURITY of HEALTH SOFTWARE PRODUCTS designed to operate on general computing platforms and intended to be placed on the market without dedicated hardware, and its primary focus is on the requirements for MANUFACTURERS.

### 1.2 Field of Application

This document covers the entire lifecycle including design, development, VALIDATION, installation, maintenance, and disposal of HEALTH SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

In each referenced standard, the term "medical device" or "medical device software" is to be substituted by the term "HEALTH SOFTWARE" or "HEALTH SOFTWARE PRODUCT", as appropriate.

IEC 82304-1 does not apply to HEALTH SOFTWARE which is intended to become part of specific hardware designed for health use. Specifically, it does not apply to:

a) medical electrical equipment or systems covered by the IEC 60601/IEC 80601 series;
b) in vitro diagnostic equipment covered by the IEC 61010 series; or
c) implantable devices covered by the ISO 14708 series.

### 1.3 Compliance

Compliance with this document is determined by inspection of all documentation required by this document.

Assessment of compliance is carried out and documented by the MANUFACTURER. Where the HEALTH SOFTWARE PRODUCT is subject to regulatory requirements, external assessment may take place.

Where this document normatively references parts or clauses of other standards focused on SAFETY or SECURITY, the MANUFACTURER may use alternative methods to demonstrate compliance if the process results are demonstrably equivalent and the RESIDUAL RISK remains acceptable.
